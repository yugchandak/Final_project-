        "#### DESCRIPTION OF PAPER:\n",
        "The BERT and T5 models uses datasets of questions with introduced disfluencies not present in the original questions to learn how to remove disfluencies from questions and produce answers to the questions.\n",
        "*********************************************************************************************************************\n",
        "#### PROBLEM STATEMENT :\n",
        "* Try to replicate the results given in paper on different datasets with a different question-answering model.\n",
        "* Introduce a different model to answer the questions from which the disfluencies have been removed.\n",
        "* Choose a story dataset for the model to learn and answer questions about.\n",

        "*********************************************************************************************************************\n",
        "#### CONTEXT OF THE PROBLEM:\n",
        "* The topic of disfluencies does not get enough attention in NLP, even though it is ever-present in human conversation.\n",
        "* This is mostly because of the lack of datasets containing disfluencies.\n",
        "* This is a bit of an issue because when humans use voice input on language models they'd have to be mostly fluent every time else the models misunderstand and/or misinterpreat the information.\n",
        "*********************************************************************************************************************\n",
        "#### SOLUTION:\n",
        "* This research was done using a database of original questions and the same questions with removed disfluencies.\n",
        "* The two models BERT and T5 were both trained to remove disfluencies from questions.\n"

He is also known for writing ''Troy'' (2004) and co-writing ''X-Men Origins: Wolverine'' (2009).\\n\\n==Early life==\\nBenioff was born David Friedman in New York City, to a Jewish family who emigrated from Austria, Romania, Germany, Poland and Russia. He is the son of Barbara (Benioff) and Stephen Friedman, who is a former head of Goldman Sachs. He is a distant cousin of Salesforce founder Marc Benioff. As an adult, he uses the last name Benioff, his mother's maiden name, to avoid confusion with other writers named David Friedman.

Martin, and its television adaptation ''Game of Thrones''. He is the second son of Steffon Baratheon, the lord of Storm's End, and his wife Lady Cassana Estermont, and brother to King Robert and Renly. He is the Lord of Dragonstone and a claimant to the Iron Throne after his elder brother's death. Stannis's goals are frequently impeded by his lack of manpower and resources, owing to his unpopularity with other noble houses. He must therefore rely on the counsel of the foreign priestess Melisandre and his right-hand man, lowborn smuggler Davos Seaworth, who later becomes his Hand of the King. Stannis often struggles to escape the shadow of his two more overtly charismatic brothers, particularly Robert.\\n\\nThough first mentioned in 1996's ''A Game of Thrones'', Stannis formally appeared in ''A Clash of Kings'' (1998), ''A Storm of Swords'' (2000) and ''A Dance with Dragons'' (2011).

R. Martin conceived The Red Wedding during the earliest stages of the planning of his saga, when he was envisioning a trilogy with The Red Wedding as one of the climactic events at the end of the first of the three books. Martin was inspired by a couple of events in Scottish history. One of them was the 15th century historical event known as the \"Black Dinner\", where the Scottish king invited the chieftains of the powerful Clan Douglas to a feast at Edinburgh Castle. A black bull\\'s head, the symbol of death, was served as the last course of the dinner while a single drum was playing in the background, and the Douglases were murdered.

He even felt attached to the minor characters killed during the massacre. It was so painful for him that he skipped the chapter and continued writing, and only when the rest of the book was finished, he \"forced himself\" to come back to the dreaded scene. In 2012, at ComicCon he even joked that \"he will visit a country with no television when the episode goes on air\".\\n\\nMartin also said he killed off Robb because he believed the audience would assume that the story was about Ned Stark\\'s heir avenging his death and wished to keep them guessing.

In micro gravity or zero gravity, such as an environment in outer space, convection no longer occurs, and the flame becomes spherical, with a tendency to become more blue and more efficient (although it may go out if not moved steadily, as the CO2 from combustion does not disperse as readily in micro gravity, and tends to smother the flame). There are several possible explanations for this difference, of which the most likely is that the temperature is sufficiently evenly distributed that soot is not formed and complete combustion occurs. Experiments by NASA reveal that diffusion flames in micro gravity allow more soot to be completely oxidized after they are produced than diffusion flames on Earth, because of a series of mechanisms that behave differently in micro gravity when compared to normal gravity conditions.

The publication of ''A Game of Thrones'' caused Martin's following to grow, with fan sites springing up and a Trekkie-like society of followers evolving that meet regularly. Westeros.org, one of the main ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' fansites with about seventeen thousand registered members , was co-founded in 1999 by a Swedish-based fan of Cuban descent, Elio M. García, Jr., as well as Linda Antonsson, who introduced him to the series; their involvement with Martin's work has now become semi-professional. The Brotherhood Without Banners, an unofficial fan club operating globally, was formed in 2001. Their founders and other longtime members are among Martin's good friends.\\n\\nMartin runs an official website and administers a lively blog with the assistance of Ty Franck. He also interacts with fandom by answering emails and letters, although he stated in 2005 that their sheer numbers might leave them unanswered for years. \", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 49}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '703a5171ea56d08cd5d5005fa2c67d52'}>,\n",
